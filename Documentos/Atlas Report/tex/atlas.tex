\chapter{Atlas - Feature Modelling Tool}
\label{chap:atlas}

In this chapter, the design and implementation of Atlas are expanded on based on the technologies and notations previously explored in Chapters \ref{chap:notations} and \ref{chap:architecture} and the requirements elicited in Chapter \ref{chap:requirements}.

%----------------------------------------------

\section{Prototyping}

This section serves to define the prototyping stage of the Atlas research, which will be used to better define the capabilities of the technologies raised in Chapter \ref{chap:architecture} so as to aid in the selection of the ones being used in the implementation of the tool.

%----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Diagramming Prototype}

The first prototyping stage of Atlas will be the exploration of the capabilities of the diagramming libraries raised in Subsection \ref{sec:diaglibs}. For this prototyping stage, certain diagram dispositions and diagramming functions are raised as critical points based on the research team's experience with previous implementation of diagramming tools, particularly feature modeling tools \cite{LASER:2015b} \cite{RODRIGUES:2014}.
