\chapter{Feature Modeling Notations}
\label{chap:notations}

This chapter will present the Feature Modelling notations studied by this project, including their common characteristics and peculiarities. While Atlas' architecture is being designed to be independent of notations and to be easily extensible by external contributors, the authors will maintain a "master" version of the tool. This chapter presents the notations that will be supported by the authors' version, including the algorithms that are used to convert between notations. The names of the notations are given based on the generally-used naming conventions found in the literature, and are often not explicitly given within the original authors' description.
